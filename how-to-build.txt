First, please download the Android NDK and Golang SDK
Second, edit build.bat and change the path after ANDROID_NDK_HOME to the location of the NDK you downloaded
Then, make sure the Golang SDK has been added to the system environment variables
Finally, run build.bat and then check if the binary files for each platform are successfully built in the build folder

e.g.
-> You have set ANDROID_NDK_HOME=D:\androidndk\android-ndk-r27c-windows\android-ndk-r27c
-> Then you have successfully installed the Golang SDK and added it to the system variables
-> You ran build.bat and then checked the build folder for the DragonFly binaries for various platforms
