### What did i do?
- I compiled the source code of DragonFly and made some distributable binary that is compatible with multiple platforms.

### What's the benefit of that?
- Now, you don't need to download the Golang runtime and manually compile with go run main.go. All you need to do is easily double-click/use the terminal to run the corresponding version of the binary, and you can easily launch the DragonFly server.
  
### How many platforms have binaries been made so far?
- Currently, I have built the DragonFly executable for Windows, Linux, MacOS and Android, you can find what you love, choose the platform you want to run the DragonFly server, and run it!

### How should I build DragonFlu multi-platform binaries by myself?
- Please refer to ```how-to-build.txt```, download the corresponding SDK and NDK, modify ```build.bat```, and then proceed with the build operation.
