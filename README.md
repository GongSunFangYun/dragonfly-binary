### What did i do?
- I compiled the source code of DragonFly and made some distributable binary that is compatible with multiple platforms.

### What's the benefit of that?
- Now, you don't need to download the Golang runtime and manually compile with go run main.go. All you need to do is easily double-click/use the terminal to run the corresponding version of the binary, and you can easily launch the DragonFly server.
  
### How many platforms have binaries been made so far?
- Currently, I have built the DragonFly executable for Windows, Linux, MacOS and Android, you can find what you love, choose the platform you want to run the DragonFly server, and run it!

#### Support Platform
| Platform       | File                          |
|----------------|-------------------------------|
| Windows (x64)  | `dragonfly_windows_amd64.exe` |
| Linux (x64)    | `dragonfly_linux_amd64`       |
